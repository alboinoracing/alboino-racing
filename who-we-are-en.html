                    Our starting point is the Canossian Institute of Feltre BL,
                    in Veneto and we study
                    in a STEM high school (sience, technology,  
                    engineering, mathematics,),
                    an applied scientific school, with a
                    particular approach to study subjects. Our school still
                    equality treated no matter the religion.

                    What distinguishes our school among others
                    is the STEM week, a week that doesn't include normal studies
                    and is completely dedicated to a single project chosen by the
                    teachers. During this week we must commit ourselves to
                    create the best possible project and then show it
                    to middle school students and judges who
                    they will decide which one will be best.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Every year Formula 1 hosts a competition
                    where students from all over the world compete to
                    create the fastest, most aerodynamic, and
                    finally aesthetic car. Doing so, however, is not easy task
                    as a meticulous regulation must be followed
                    which requires the car to have specific dimensions,
                    weights, and the use
                    of specific programs, which requires a level
                    of unexpected time and effort.

                Our history
                <p class="paragraph">
                    As we were choosing groups for STEM week,
                    as soon as this project was named, he
                    enthusiasts came out and
                    immediately got to work. First thing first,
                    we had to decide on an icon for our team
                    this is when we thought about the Alboino Castle,
                    iconic of our city of origin, Feltre.
                    Afterwards we decided on the roles we would
                    specialize in: the mechanics or creation of the model;
                    aerodynamics; marketing to find sponsors and manage
                    the economic part; other minor things like the
                    creation of themed suits or posters.
