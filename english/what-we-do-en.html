        <strong class="title"> Step 1: The regulation</strong>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The first step was to read the technical regulations,
            regarding for example weight and size measures.
            Some rules made the entire process difficult,
            especially because if not respected,
            the judges would then take away points away from us during the
            competition.

        <strong class="title"> Step 2: What is a Webinar?</strong>
        <p class="paragraph">
            About once a month, with non-regular meetings, F1 in Schools
            offered informative webinars in which aspects that
            wern't evident or not defined in the regulations were explained.
            For example, many online meetings dealt with
            aerodynamics and how we should modify our car to make it as fast as possible.
            Others gave advice on economic issues, such as
            the most effective strategies for finding sponsors.

        <strong class="title"> Step 3: Our logo</strong>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Another step that took a lot of effort was to define our identity,
            with a name and an image that would be immediately
            recognizable. For this, as already said in the
            <em class="link">Who we are</em> section, we chose the
            Castle of Alboino, an iconic symbol of the city of Feltre, the
            place where we come from. Then for the logo, we used <em class="link">Canva</em>,
            a useful site for creating presentations,
            that we used to search for images of the tower,
            the wings and finally the flags.

        <strong class="title"> Step 4: Finding sponsors</strong>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Having sponsors is not something to overlook,
            since it's a fundamental necessity,
            as they are our only economic support. For this project we were committed
            to not having expenses that would weigh either the school or us students. Fortunately, the search
            was long but not difficult.

            what will happen during the day of the race,
            such as the mandatory requirements for participants, the timetable, 
            how many points will be awarded for each phase of the project development...

        <strong class="title"> Step 6: The portfolio</strong>
        <p class="paragraph">
            If you didn't know, a portfolio is a
            presentation in paper format, with the contents similar to what you can
            find on our website, but in a more detailed version, which contains
            every detail regarding the procedures followed to prepare for
            this race, every step and action carried out to achieve the
            goal of building the F1 car.

        <strong class="title"> Step 7: The programs used</strong>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The programs used for the development of the car
            were not chosen by us, but instead provided
            by the Formula 1 in Schools team and are <em class="link">Fusion 360</em> and
            <em class="link">Ansys</em>. Fusion is the program
            used to model the car which is full of
            complex uses that require a huge amount of
            time and dedication to learn. Ansys on the other hand
            is used to control the aerodynamics and even
            though it is really easy to use, learning it wasn't at all
            due to the lack of online guides.

        <strong class="title"> Step 8: The final touches and the race</strong>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Now that we are at the end of our journey, the only things
            missing to do are to print the car with the 3D printer
            that one of our members provided, prepare the presentation and
            get to the race, where we will have the morning to prepare,
            and then the afternoon for the actual race and the exhibition.
